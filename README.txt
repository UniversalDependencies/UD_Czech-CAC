The UD_Czech-CAC treebank is based on the Czech Academic Corpus 2.0 (CAC;
Český akademický korpus; ČAK), created at the Charles University in Prague.
The treebank consists of 650,000 words, annotated morphologically and
syntactically. The first version of CAC was created by a team from the
Institute of the Czech Language, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, led by
Marie Těšitelová, in 1971-1985; its original name was “Korpus věcného stylu”.
It was reshaped and made compatible with the Prague Dependency Treebank between
2007 (CAC 1.0) and 2008 (CAC 2.0); these corpora are distributed by the
Linguistic Data Consortium. The corpus has now been converted to Universal
Dependencies and made freely available under the CreativeCommons license
(see LICENSE.txt).

The CAC contains mostly unabridged articles taken from a wide range of media.
These articles include newspapers, magazines, and transcripts of spoken
language from radio and TV programs covering administration, journalism and
scientific fields. The texts are taken from the 1970s and 1980s and thus, the
selection of texts is influenced by the political and cultural climate of this
time period.
